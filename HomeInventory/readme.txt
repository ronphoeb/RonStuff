A simple example web application to demonstrate the Model View Controller Design Pattern applied common problem.

This example uses a home inventory item as a basic unit for the model and allows for a manipulation of a list of items with CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) capabilities.  The initial tool for persistent data was a flat file using comma separated fields with semicolon item separation, very rudimentary and elementary.  An expansion would benefit from a SQL database and probably would have been easier to implement.

The example employs PHP as the implementation language for the model and controller while a combination of PHP, HTML5, and Javascript was used for the view.
 
A couple of simple templets were used to set up the basic structure.  The Model View Controller template was adapted from "Model View Controller Tutorial in PHP: http://php-html.net/tutorials/model-view-controller-in-php/".  The View templet was imported as "simple_personal_template_1592" from "http://all-free-download.com/free-website-templates/".  The templets were very basic and only used as a starting point for the project.

The additional code is commented as to its use and purpose.  Pleses consult the code for details.  The code is not bullet proof and there will be some holes that may need to be plugged and bugs that may need to be exterminated.  Some additional effort would be needed to make this project ready for prime time.
